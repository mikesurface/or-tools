This file describes how to install the or-tools libraries.
These libraries have been tested under:
  - ubuntu 10.04 and up (32 and 64 bit).
  - Mac OS X Snow Leopard with xcode 3.2.x and 4.x (64 bit)
  - Mac OS X Lion with xcode 4.x (64 bit).
  - Microsoft Windows with Visual Studio 2010 express C++ and
    Visual studio 2010 (32 and 64 bit).

Upon checking out the svn repository, you will get the following structure:
